<b>Musical Structure – Udacity ABND Project 4</b>

This is my Musical Structure project for the Udacity Scholarship. The purpose of the project is to build an app that may function as a framework or a structure for a music or sound based app. 

<b>My Music Player made possible by Bensound</b>
Actually, for now, only his title’s. His royalty free music collection gave me the idea to build an app that plays relaxing music. MyMusic is really nothing more than a slightly unpolished frame – but maybe it will be something great once!
